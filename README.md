# Northcoders News API

For instructions, please head over to [L2C NC News](https://l2c.northcoders.com/courses/be/nc-news).

If you wish to clone and run this project locally, you must set up two files:
> .env.test
> .env.development

In each of these files you must then specify the database you wish you interact with:

For .env.test :
PGDATABASE=nc_news_test

for .env.development:
PGDATABASE=nc_news

You must do this as by default these files are gitignored.
